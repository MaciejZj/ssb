## Jump start

1. A POSIX compliant shell and your favourite markdown renderer (pandoc by
   default) are required.
2. Download ssb and place it in your `PATH` or inside your blog directory.
3. Run `ssb -g` to generate html and css templates. Adjust the header and
   the footer to your liking, you can customize the stylesheet, use a css theme,
   or your favourite style for markdown.
4. Write your index.md page and posts in `posts` directory.
5. Run `ssb index.md` to generate `html` files. Ssb will append header, list of
   posts and footer to each file.
6. The timestamps near posts titles are generated from modification dates of
   markdown files. 
   If you wish to change them use `touch -d` command on them.
7. Publish your blog.
